INTRODUCTION					*todotxt*
						*todotxt-introduction*

This plugin adds support for todo.txt files, including syntax highlighting, a
little folding and some useful mappings for working quickly with them.

SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING				*ft-todotxt-syntax*

By default, the whole lines of entries with priority levels A, B and C are
specially highlighted. Lines of any other priority are not highlighted, but
only the priority marker at the start of the line.

Note that the line as a whole is highlighted separately from the marker.
Depending on how you want to highlight things, this may either make your
desired highlighting possible, or it may make it mildly painful to work with.

If you want to apply something to many or all letters, iterating over the
letters with a |:for| loop and using |:exec| can reduce the required code from
around 26 lines: >
	hi link todoPriorityA Something
	hi link todoPriorityB Something
	hi link todoPriorityC Something
	" ... twenty lines omitted ...
	hi link todoPriorityX Something
	hi link todoPriorityY Something
	hi link todoPriorityZ Something
to just these three lines: >
	for letter in split("ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ", '\zs')
		exec "hi link todoPriority" . letter . " Something"
	endfor
However, you probably will not even need that. By default, the {todoPriority*}
highlighting groups are linked to {todoPriority}, and {todoPriority*Line}
(apart from A, B and C, by default) to {todoPriorityLine}.

If you want to avoid the special highlighting of A, B and C priority lines,
there is a variable which you can set: >
	let g:todo_priority_abc_special = 0
Then A, B and C priority lines will also be linked to {todoPriorityLine}

MAPPINGS					*todotxt-mappings*

TODO(Chris): document this.

FOLDING						*todotxt-folding*

|Folding| is supported, hiding completed tasks.
